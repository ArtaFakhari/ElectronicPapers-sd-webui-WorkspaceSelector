# Config Profiles Extension

This extension is for AUTOMATIC1111's [Stable Diffusion web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)

Allows swapping and maintaining config files from a separate UI tab. In practice, due to extensions, save locations, 
and other important configurations being stored in the... well, config file, this essentially creates different "profiles".

e.g. have a sfw profile with the nsfw-censor extension enabled, 
and a separate output directory so other images aren't visible in image-viewer, etc.
